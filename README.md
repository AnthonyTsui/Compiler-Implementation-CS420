## Compiler Project for CSc 42000 Spring 2019
> Programming language is optional with no restrictions
> Standard Compiler Components:
>  - Lexer (Tokenizer) 
>  - Parser
>  - Semantic Analyzer 
>  - Code Generator (IR, probably going to use LLVM)

## Status:
* Current using Python for implementation
* Libraries being used as a learning tool: rPLY, LLVM/lite
* rPLY for Lexer & Parser
* LLVM for generating machine code
* Current language input: Unknown because the professor hasn't told us yet. So thats cool. Will assume Pascal as input for now
